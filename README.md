## Features

- **Asynchronous Coroutines**: High-concurrency powered by C++20 `co_await`.
- **Type-Safe Extraction**: Automatic injection of `Path<T>`, `Body<T>`, and `Query<T>`.
- **Explicit Services**: Register and resolve shared services without hiding application wiring.
- **Focused Middleware**: Rate limiting, CORS, static files, and request context.

## Installation

Install moji as a CMake package, or consume it directly with `FetchContent`.

```bash
// YOLO mode
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creedpetitt/mojito/main/install.sh | bash
```

> **Note:** The installer (`install.sh`) installs only the core build tools.

## Local Development

Build moji from this repository:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Build and run the test suite:

```bash
./build.sh test
```

## Quick Start

1. **Write** your logic (e.g., in `src/main.cpp`):
   ```cpp
   #include <moji/app.h>

   using namespace moji;

   int main() {
       App app;

       app.get("/hello", [](Response& res) -> Async<void> {
           res.send("Hello from moji");
           co_return;
      });

       app.listen(8080);
   }
   ```

2. **Build and run** with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   cmake --build build --parallel
   ./build/my-api
   ```
